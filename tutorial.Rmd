### Introduction
This page provides supplemental information and a walkthrough tutorial to accompany the essay, "A Mathematical Theory of Authorial Intention." 

First off ... **Thank you so much for reading!** I know the essay is difficult and strange, but it was incredibly fun to write, and I'm so excited to see it finally out. Thanks for taking the time to learn more about the work. Please know that you are absolutely welcome to contact me with questions. Even if your question(s) seem(s) silly or mundane or intrusive. Trust me -- I'd love to hear from you! 

This tutorial is meant to serve three different purposes:

1. For finders of fault, it will expose all the flaws so that I may be properly chastised.
2. For the DH-curious, it will show what this kind of work looks from 'behind the scenes'.
3. For the math-curious, it will suggest a path for incorporating self-directed mathematics learning into coding practice, making both easier.

Before we even begin, there's something important to say. Critics of quantitative analysis in the humanities often like to point out ways that digital humanities scholarship fails to be objective. Choices made in the process of analysis, they point out with grave expressions of concern, change the results of the analysis. What seems like objective truth is really just an arbitrary consequence of your procedures! J'accuse Gavin!

J'avoue! Une observation astucieuse, monsieur! Je ne vous propose pas ici le truc divin de l'objectivité scientifique, ni les outils de nos prétendus vice-rois des humanités numériques, mais plutôt un livre de cuisine rempli de recettes folles pour les intellectuels damnés.

(that was google translate. i don't read french. i was just trying to sound like rimbaud. sorry. but the point remains.)

### Setup and Data Loading

If you're just reading this online, you don't need to do anything. But if you'd like to follow along and recreate the graphs on your own machine (as well as to play around with analyses of your own) you'll have to download some materials.

Before beginning, you'll need to install


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
